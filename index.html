						## NNg Report – Mobile Usability Guidelines

						Today we're going to cover, **Content**, **Location Information**, **Instructions & Help**, and **Initial Experience**. 
					</textarea>
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="2-content" data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						## Content 

						> It’s well known that people rarely read every word on a web page; instead they scan.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="3-scannability">
				
					<section data-slideID="3a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### Scannability 

							> Use bullet points, spacing, and headings to draw users’ attention to the gist of your content.

							* Headings
							* Bold text
							* Different colours
							* Bullet points
							* First words in a paragraph
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="3b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>

							![Figure 1](img/fig-1.png)
							
							`Two similar interfaces. OSHA for Android used bullets, headings, and spacing to support scannability`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="4-concise-sentences">
				
					<section data-slideID="4a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### Use brief, concise sentences over complex ones.  

							> People rarely have the uninterrupted time to read carefully a whole paragraph on mobile. It’s best to strive for short sentences that **start with the essential**.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="4b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>

							It is also best to write copy so key words are at the start of your sentences.

							![Figure 2](img/fig-2.png)
							
							`“These [checkboxes] are annoying because sometimes you read them, and you have to read it because you don’t know if it’s going to be ‘tick this box if you don’t want this crap sent to you’”`
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="5-left-align">
					
					<section data-slideID="5a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### Left-aligned text 

							Use left aligned text when possible. It's much easier for the user to read long sentences 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="5b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>

							> The eye doesn’t have to find a start point for each new line

							![Figure 3](img/fig-3.png)
							
							`Modnotebooks.com used centered text for their website instead of left- justified text.`
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="6-secondary-information">
					
					<section data-slideID="6a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### Defer secondary information to secondary pages or collapse it under accordions.

							> It's a tough decision to defer information to secondary screens. But remember: if you make the first screen too dense, then nobody will read anything.
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="6b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							![Figure 4](img/fig-4.png)
							
							`IMDb.com showed only the information likely to elicit interest from most users on the movie page. The complete movie details were delegated to a secondary page.`

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="7-truncate">
					
					<section data-slideID="7a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							### Do not arbitrarily truncate text 
							
							> Although we do recommend that you defer secondary content to secondary pages that does not equate with truncating a paragraph to the first few lines and forcing users to go to another page or expand an accordion to read more. 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="7c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							The content presented on the main page should truly be the most important part. 
							
							![Figure 5](img/fig-5.png)
							
							`In both cases above, truncating a paragraph did not result in a satisfactory summary meaning it's fairly useless.`

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="8-links-copy">
					
					<section data-slideID="8a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							### Use links with good information scent

							> The text of the links should be transparent and should set good expectations about the content of the page. Meaningless links suck as *'Next Article'* may be easy to generate automatically, but are too vague. 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="8b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							![Figure 6](img/fig-6.png)
							
							`Left: Yahoo News Digest for iPhone showed the links to stories as numbers (no text description), which made it convenient for seeing how many stories you’ve read, but not for knowing what they were. Right: Parents.com link to Prev Post carried little information scent.`

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="9-readabilit">
					
					<section data-slideID="9a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							### Readability 

							Most of this section is more applicable to article based sites than applications, but some key points: 
							
							* If you are using a large body / paragraph text size give users the option to resize it
							* Place these font-size controls in a somewhere easy to find
							* Do not use excessively large type 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="9b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* Use solid backgrounds behind text, not photography / gradients
							* Use high contrast between the font colour and the page background colour
							* If you link through to an article / secondary page don't repeat your summary / preview content. 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="10-images">
					
					<section data-slideID="8a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							### Images

							Not applicable to us, but still interesting:
							
							* Only include images on your website if they add meaningful content. 
							* Do not use images for decoration purposes. 
							* Avoid stock photography. 
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="8b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							* Use captions for images that are part of an article only if their meaning is not clear from the content of the article. Explain the purpose of adding an image if there is a story behind it. 
							* Do not use images of text for navigation links (Or any text)

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="8c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							Do not shuffle text around as images get loaded. Use placeholders as images load. 
							
							![Figure 7](img/fig-7.png)
							
							`Bad example: The homepage of ABC.com before (left) and after (right) the images got loaded`

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="8d" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							![Figure 8](img/fig-8.png)
							
							`Good example: BBC.co.uk: The text did not get shuffled around as the images loaded.`

						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="11-video">
					
					<section data-slideID="11a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							### Video

							Do not start videos automatically
							
							> Mobile devices are used in a variety of circumstances, so don’t embarrass your users by automatically playing a sound or a video when they have not requested it.
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="11b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							
							If you have videos on your site, offer a textual description of what the video is about
							
							> Videos take a long time to load, so you want to give the user all the information they need to decide whether it’s worth watching them. We recommend that next to each video you include a short textual summary.
							
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<!-- <section data-slideID="location-information">
				
					<section data-slideID="l1" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Location information
							
							(Most of this really isn't reliant for iManage products)
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="12b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Key points 
							
							* When users are asked if they want to read user manuals, they always say “no” (and often laugh)
							* If you app needs a user manual, it’s probably too complex for mobile
							* On mobile users cannot study instructions and apply them at the same time
							* Use instructional overlays where possible 
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
				</section> -->
				
				
				<section data-slideID="12-instructions-and-help">
				
					<section data-slideID="12a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Instructions and help 
							
							> If you app needs a user manual, it’s probably too complex for mobile.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="12b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* When users are asked if they want to read user manuals, they always say “no” (and often laugh)
							* If you app needs a user manual, it’s probably too complex for mobile
							* On mobile users cannot study instructions and apply them at the same time
							* Use instructional overlays where possible 
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="13-instructional-overlays">
				
					<section data-slideID="13a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Instructional overlays
							
							* Instructional overlays should contain only tips that are truly necessary and not obvious
								* eg Explaining that a search box is a search box is counterproductive and wastes user attention
							* Use the instructional overlays to show only those features that are less discoverable or standard
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="13b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 9](img/fig-9.png)
							
							`Bad Examples: Left: Home Depot explaining the self-explanatory scan icon. Right: Trulia explaining the obvious Save Search button.`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="14-coach-mark">
				
					<section data-slideID="14a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### Coach marks
							
							* Make the coach mark clearly distinct from the page in the background
							* Users should be able to tell what is an instructional overlay and what is the actual interface. 
								* User a different font
								* Dim the background 
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="14b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 10](img/fig-10.png)
							
							`The “handwriting” font used for the coach marks was clearly distinct from the interface. (Unfortunately fonts like these can also be harder to read`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="14c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 11](img/fig-11.png)
							
							`Although the app used a different font for the tips, because the interface elements were not dimmed, it wasn’t clear whether this was an active page`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="15-contextual-tips">
				
					<section data-slideID="15a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Contextual Tips
							
							> Tips that are shown exactly when the user needs them are the best help system.
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
					<section data-slideID="15b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* Tips are more effective than user manuals
							* Tips are more likely to be read if:
								* They are related to the task
								* They appear at a time when the user is waiting for a download (or some other event)
							* Tips that are too obvious they hold little interest for people
							* Tips that occur too often tend to be annoying
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
					<section data-slideID="15c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* Tips should have clear, simple language
							* Tips should point directly to the design element instead of mentioning it by name
							* Tips should explain the function not only the action
							* Phase tips out as users learn the interface
							* Do not use vocal tips
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
					<section data-slideID="15d" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 12](img/fig-12.png)
							
							`Good examples: Left: ShopStyle for iPhone showed contextual tips about features that were more advanced (save an item or create an alert for an item) after the user performed her first search and was browsing through the results. Right: Bloomberg for iPhone showed a tip about revealing the navigation menu at the beginning of the session.`
						</textarea>
					</section>
				
					<section data-slideID="15e" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 13](img/fig-13.png)
							
							`Bad examples: Just Park for iPhone (left) and Adobe PS (right) created tips that were hard to understand. Just Park used designer jargon (“Y toolbar”) and Adobe PS had a long way of saying that the photo was automatically saved.`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="16-user-manuals">
				
					<section data-slideID="16a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### User Manuals
							
							> Anything that has more than one page of help or explanations qualifies as a user manual
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="16b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* User manuals are pretty much useless on mobile
								* they contain a lot of information that users must memorize
								* users cannot be expected to remember more than one or two things from them at best
							* They can be made available in the app, but should not be mandatory
							* Contextual tips can be much more effective than any user manual
							* If you decide that you absolutely need a user manual, make sure that it’s easy to read
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="16c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 14](img/fig-14.png)
							
							`Bad example: Mailbox for iPhone forced users to sit through a tutorial explaining the different gestures. The tutorial was interactive; however, the many gestures and features explained were overwhelming.`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-slideID="17-initial-experience">
				
					<section data-slideID="17a" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Initial experience 
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="17b" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							* Don’t use a launch screen if possible.
							* Use progress indicators that keep users informed of the state of the download
							* If you must use a launch screen make sure it's as similar as possible to the first functional screen
							* Don’t start app with a video or a sound effects
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="17c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 15](img/fig-15.png)
							
							`Bad examples: Launch screens do not bring any value to the user and they can give the feeling that they slow the app down.`
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section data-slideID="17c" data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							![Figure 16](img/fig-16.png)
							
							`Good example: BBC News Launch screens similar to the first screen make the experience seamless and give users time to get used to the app.`
